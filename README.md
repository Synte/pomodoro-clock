## The Odin Project

### Pomodoro Clock

> Note that this project is intended to be an introduction to pair programming, however I am completing it on my own to practise my HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system where you work for a period of time then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on.

We are going to make a Pomodoro clock which will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again.
